Alexa skills main functionalities using Python

 we will create a basic skill that will accompany us throughout our 5-posts journey. I chose a case study that will allow us to add (and therefore learn about) the main functionalities every Alexa skills developer should be aware of.
 
The third post is about adding Alexa Presentation Language (APL) to our skill. In other words, we will provide a visual experience to  Alexa devices that have screens. 

After that, we will discover how to implement a multi-language skill in the fourth post, that is to have your skill speak different languages depending on where your users are.

Finally, the last tutorial will cover the monetization techniques, or to put it another way, it is a tutorial on how to earn money through your skill ðŸ’°.
